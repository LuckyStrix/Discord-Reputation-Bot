# 🌟 Discord Reputation Bot V3.2

A reputation system for Discord marketplace communities. Members review each other with **1–10 star ratings and notes** inside forum posts, the bot gates new posts behind your **Terms of Service**, and finished listings are **closed automatically** to keep the marketplace tidy.

## 🆕 What's New in V3.2

- 🔒 **Security fixes**: every admin command is permission-checked, `!sync` is owner-only, and closed posts can no longer receive reviews
- ⏰ **Reliable auto-close**: correct timing in every time zone, and archived posts are still closed
- 🔁 **Restart-safe**: TOS prompts, buttons and log embeds keep working after the bot restarts
- 🧹 **Cleaner threads**: the review panel updates in place instead of reposting after every review
- 🗑️ **Web dashboard removed**: the bot is now Discord-only
- 🧪 **Tests and CI**: a pytest suite runs on Python 3.11–3.14 for every pull request

## 🚀 Features

### 🔒 TOS gating
- New posts in tracked forums get a Terms of Service prompt with a live countdown
- The post owner must agree before anyone can chat; declining or ignoring it closes the post
- Messages sent while the prompt is pending are removed

### ⭐ Reviews
- **⭐ Leave a Review** opens a form with a 1–10 rating and optional notes
- Reviewers must have posted in the thread, can't review themselves, and can review each post once
- The panel shows the owner's average rating, star bar and three latest reviews
- `/reviews @user` and `/leaderboard` let anyone look up reputations

### ⏰ Auto-close
- A post's first review starts a configurable timer (default 24 hours)
- The owner can cancel it with one click (useful for multi-item listings)
- Owners can close their own posts; closing a post with no reviews asks for confirmation

### 👑 Administration
- Server administrators, listed users and listed roles are bot admins
- `/settings` opens an interactive panel for auto-close, TOS text and bot status
- Every action is logged to a staff channel, with one live-updating embed per post

## 🚀 Quick Start

Full instructions, including Discord Developer Portal setup, are in **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

1. **Install Python 3.11+** and clone this repository.
2. **Create the bot** in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), enable the **Server Members** and **Message Content** intents, and invite it with the permissions listed in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#2-invite-the-bot).
3. **Configure it:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env                              # add your bot token
   cp data/config.yaml.example data/config.yaml      # add your forum/log channel IDs
   ```
4. **Install and run:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  (macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python bot.py
   ```
   On Windows you can instead double-click `RunMe.bat`.
5. **Register slash commands:** as the bot's owner, type `!sync guild` in your server (instant) or `!sync` (global, up to an hour).

## 💬 Commands

| Command | Who | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `/reviews @user` | Everyone | A user's rating and latest reviews |
| `/leaderboard` | Everyone | Top 10 users by rating |
| `/settings` | Admins | Interactive settings panel |
| `/channel_set #forum` | Admins | Track another forum |
| `/log #channel` | Admins | Set the log channel |
| `/auto_close_toggle [true/false]` | Admins | Show or change auto-close |
| `/auto_close_hours <1-168>` | Admins | Set the auto-close timer |
| `/send_review_ui` | Admins | Post the review panel in the current thread |
| `/admin_add`, `/admin_remove`, `/admin_list` | Admins | Manage admin users |
| `/admin_role_add`, `/admin_role_remove` | Admins | Manage admin roles |
| `!sync [guild]` | Bot owner | Register slash commands |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Slash commands don't appear.** Run `!sync guild` in your server as the bot owner. A global `!sync` can take up to an hour.

**"Only admins can use this command."** Add your user ID to `admin_ids` in `data/config.yaml`, or have a server administrator run `/admin_add` for you.

**The bot doesn't respond to new posts.** Check that the forum's ID is in `forums` (or add it with `/channel_set`) and that the bot can view the forum and send messages in threads.

**Messages aren't removed during the TOS prompt, or posts don't lock.** The bot needs **Manage Messages** and **Manage Threads**.

**"DISCORD_TOKEN is not set."** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your bot token.

## 🧪 Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
