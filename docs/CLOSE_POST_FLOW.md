# How Posts Are Closed

Closing a post archives and locks the thread, records it in the database and updates the post's log embed. Buttons in a closed post reply "🔒 This post is closed." and do nothing else.

## Close Post button

```
Clicked by…
├── someone else                → "Only the thread creator or admins can close this post."
├── an admin (not the owner)
│   ├── admin_close_confirmation: true  → type "Yes" to confirm → closed
│   └── admin_close_confirmation: false → closed immediately
└── the post owner
    ├── post has reviews        → closed immediately
    └── post has no reviews     → type "Yes" to confirm → closed
```

The confirmation accepts "Yes" in any capitalisation; anything else cancels.

| Who closed it | Message in the thread | Log status |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Owner, with reviews | 🔒 This thread is now closed by its creator. | ❌ Closed |
| Owner, no reviews | 🔒 This thread is now closed by its creator (no reviews received). | ❌ Closed without reviews |
| Admin | 🔒 This thread has been closed by admin @Name. | ❌ Force closed by admin @Name |

## Automatic closing

### After the first review
When a post receives its first review (and `auto_close_enabled` is on), the bot schedules it to close after `auto_close_hours` and posts a notice with a countdown. The owner can click **I have multiple items - Keep thread open** to cancel. A cancelled post is never rescheduled.

The bot checks for due posts every 10 minutes, so a post can close up to 10 minutes after its timer ends. Posts that Discord has already archived are still closed and locked.

### TOS not answered
If the owner doesn't answer the TOS prompt within `tos_timeout_seconds` (default 30), the post is closed. Declining the TOS closes it straight away. Both survive restarts: a prompt that expired while the bot was offline is handled as soon as it comes back.
